# Welcome to the Coop Game

The **Coop Game** is a research tool developed to assist autistic children in developing cooperative skills. This project is a collaboration between the Department of Computer Science and the Department of Psychology at Bar-Ilan University.

## Overview

The Coop Game is an innovative blend of various technologies designed to create a seamless and dynamic experience for users. Below is a detailed overview of the different components and technologies involved in this project.

### Game Technology

- **Game Development**: The game itself is developed using **Phaser**, a powerful cross-platform game development framework for Javascript. The HTML version ensures accessibility and a smooth gaming experience across different devices.

  - [Phaser Comunity](https://discord.com/invite/phaser)

### Backend Infrastructure

- **Serverless Computing**: The backend is entirely serverless, with all functionalities based on cloud functions deployed on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**. This architecture ensures scalability and efficient resource management.
- **Database**: The project utilizes **MongoDB** for its database needs, providing robust and flexible data storage solutions.

### Additional Services

1. **Admin Panel**: An admin panel provides access to analytical data and information for each user. This panel helps researchers and administrators manage and analyze game data effectively.
