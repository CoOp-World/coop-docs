The site allows parents to view their children's progress, achievements, and other relevant statistics in a user-friendly interface. It is designed to help parents stay informed about their children's gaming activities and performance in the Co-Op World game.
The dashboard includes features such as:

- **Positive Reciprocity and its complements**: The number of times that the kid said yes after the virtual player said yes / the number of times that the virtual player said yes.
- **Negative Reciprocity and its complements**: The number of times that the kid said no after the virtual player said no / the number of times that the virtual player said no.
- The number of turns it took the kid to return yes after the virtual player said no
- The full view of the game regarding the requests and responses of the kid and the virtual player.

### **Currently, the site is not working in the serverless function only, when the data comes properly from the server it will show it visually**
