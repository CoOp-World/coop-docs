The folder will be named with the current date in the format `YYYYMMDD-ELSE` (ELSE will be replaced with some numbers).
The files will be named according to the collection names, such as `coop__config.json`, `coop__game.json`, etc.
The data can be downloaded directly from the GCS bucket using the Google Cloud interface. And after downloading, you can import the JSON files into MongoDB using the mongo Compass or the `mongoimport` command.
