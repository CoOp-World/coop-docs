In the game in the creation of a user you can choose the diffrrent sessions he will play. Each session contains levels and **when the user finish to play all the levels in a session he won't be able to play the next level, after the site is reloaded he will be able to play the next level**. In the expiriment the sessions means the diffrrent meatings.
